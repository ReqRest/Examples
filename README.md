# ReqRest Examples [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ManuelRoemer/ReqRest/_apis/build/status/ReqRest%20Examples?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/ManuelRoemer/ReqRest/_build/latest?definitionId=19&branchName=master)

This repository contains multiple example projects which highlight how to use the [ReqRest](https://github.com/ReqRest/ReqRest)
library.

Most of these examples are created to be consumed together with the [documentation](https://reqrest.github.io).
To be more specific, the example projects are written with the guides in mind, i.e. they are typically
self-contained and small.
There are exceptions though. For example, the `JsonPlaceholderClient` project is basically a standalone
example which even gets published as a NuGet package.


## Available Examples

This section contains a list of all available example projects.
Please note that examples with a `ReadMe` link below their name have a more detailed description
in another README file.
